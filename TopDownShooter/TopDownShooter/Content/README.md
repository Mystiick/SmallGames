# Using Content.mgcb
If you don't want to update Content.mgcb by hand you can use the mgcb-editor tool. It can be installed with 

`dotnet tool install --global dotnet-mgcb-editor`

Once installed, it can be launched with `mgcb-editor {path-to-content.mgcb}`. Alternatively you can just open it with `mgcb-editor` and then `File > Open > Content.mgcb`
