# SmallGames
Compilation of small games written with [MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame) with the goal of writing an encompassing engine to use for larger games.

## Goals
A shared engine between all games that implements (in no particular order):
- Entity Component System
- 2D box collision resolution
- Gravity physics
- Frustum Culling
- Local Split Screen and Shared Screen multiplayer
- Customizable mappings for Keyboard/Mouse and Xbox Controllers
    - Maybe PS 4/5 if it's not terrible

In the end, I'll have an engine that can be used for larger games or for more quickly standing up small games or prototypes. This isn't novel and is fully overengineered, but this is just for fun.

## Using the engine
TODO

## Games
The current games that exist are:
- [TopDownShooter](https://github.com/Mystiick/SmallGames/tree/master/TopDownShooter)
    - You guessed it, a Top Down Shooter
